# Applied Data Analytics – Practical Examples

This repository contains small, self-contained examples of applied data analytics and
data science problems I have worked on in professional contexts.

The focus is on:
- solving real analytical problems that arise at scale
- clarity of logic and business applicability
- simple, maintainable implementations

All examples are simplified and use synthetic or illustrative data. Most of my professional
work was developed in private, regulated environments and cannot be shared publicly.
